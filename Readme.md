Software Dev :: Baby Got Bach
=============================

A serious-ass project by Andy LeClair - andyleclair@gmail.com
-------------------------------------------------------------

Baby is program to generate some dang site-reading music.

Run Baby with the following command:

./cs4500 <input filename> <output filename>

No compilation or whatever, we've got RUBY, DOGG!

This will produce 16 bars of violin music

Running Baby with any other parameters will produce the syntax overview:

Baby Got Bach:
	usage: ./cs4500 <input doc> <output filename>

Currently, the input doc is TOTES IGNORED, BRO
